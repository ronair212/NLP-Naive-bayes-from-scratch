# NLP-Naive-bayes-from-scratch


The task of sentiment analysis is a popular and useful task in the field of Natural Language Processing. In this task, we will use the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict if a movie review has a positive or negative sentiment. The data for this task will be obtained from the movie_reviews dataset.

Step 1: Preprocessing the data and building the word frequency dictionary
In this step, the first step is to preprocess the data, which includes cleaning and transforming the text. This may involve removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing the words, and converting the words to their lowercase form. Once the data is preprocessed, we can build a word frequency dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each word in the movie reviews dataset.

Step 2: Training a model using Naive Bayes
In this step, we will use the preprocessed data and the word frequency dictionary to train a Naive Bayes model. The Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple but effective algorithm for sentiment analysis and is a popular choice in the field of NLP. During the training process, the model will learn the relationship between the words in the movie reviews and the sentiments they express.

Step 3: Testing the model
Finally, in this step, we will test the model on the test set. The model will be used to predict the sentiment of movie reviews in the test set. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated based on the number of correct predictions made by the model. Additionally, we may also use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.

In conclusion, the goal of this task is to train a Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews and to evaluate its performance. By following these three steps, we can train a sentiment analysis model that can predict the sentiment of movie reviews with a high degree of accuracy. This task provides a great foundation for further work in the field of NLP and sentiment analysis.
